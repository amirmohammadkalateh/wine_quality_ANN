# Wine Quality Prediction using Artificial Neural Network

This repository contains a Python script that uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict the quality of wine based on various physicochemical properties. The dataset used is the "Wine Quality Dataset" available on Kaggle.
## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "Wine Quality Dataset" sourced from Kaggle: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/wine-quality-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/wine-quality-dataset)

It contains information about red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine.  The features include:

*   Fixed acidity
*   Volatile acidity
*   Citric acid
*   Residual sugar
*   Chlorides
*   Free sulfur dioxide
*   Total sulfur dioxide
*   Density
*   pH
*   Sulphates
*   Alcohol
*   Quality (target variable - a score between 0 and 10)
